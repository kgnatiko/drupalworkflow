# Drupal Content Workflow Initiative
This is the main repository for the community driven Drupal Content Workflow initiative.

Problem Definition:
Drupal's content publishing and workflow system are very flexible and can be customized in many different ways. However we would like to have a easy-to-use common content intake, filtering, collaboration and publishing workflow. 

Required Drupal Modules:

  Rules Module: (https://www.drupal.org/project/rules)
  
  Workflow Module: (https://www.drupal.org/project/workflow)
