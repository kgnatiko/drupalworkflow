# Drupal Content Workflow Initiative
This is the main repository for the community driven Drupal Content Workflow initiative.

Problem Definition:
Drupal's content publishing and workflow system are very flexible and can be customized in many different ways. However we would like to have a easy-to-use common content intake, filtering, collaboration and publishing workflow. 

Required Drupal Modules:
  Rules Module: (https://www.drupal.org/project/rules)
  Workflow Module: (https://www.drupal.org/project/workflow)


**Notice**. There are different kind of techniques shown in the PnP guidance for apps/add-ins targeted to store and also for apps targeted to be deployed or created more as enterprise developed apps/add-ins. Any app/add-in which requires higher than **Manage** permission to the host web cannot be distributed using SharePoint store.*
